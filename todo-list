## TODO

variable-ize image db/main and acr/main
in func/main.tf - randomize stor acct name


- update readme with changes

- we should be able to use an object for the dashboard variables so we only have to pass one variable instead of each individually

- module readme files need to be updated and regenerated


- scrub for naming / consistency / variables (we have a LOT)

- option to deploy to AKS is missing (I think this is OK - especially for this release)
