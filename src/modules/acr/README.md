# Module Properties

This module is used to create the azure container registry to store private copies of the [Helium](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium) application containers or a private copy of the [webvalidate](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/webvalidate) container to use in this test environment

For this to work you will need to assign `AcrPull` rights to the Application Insights service to the ACR post deployment.

Example usage

```hcl
module "acr" {
source      = "../modules/acr"
NAME        = var.NAME
LOCATION    = var.LOCATION
ACR_RG_NAME = azurerm_resource_group.helium-acr.name
}
```
